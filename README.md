In this training we learn to create, test and implement Docker containers with practical and real activities, starting with understanding what a container is and how it works. We perform hands-on activities in virtual labs to understand how containers are created and deployed in real infrastructure. Once we understand what a container is, we work with them using basic Docker CLI commands. After that, we learned how to create your own custom images and how to store them in the cloud or on an on-premises infrastructure. The Training also covers creating a container cluster using specific AWS tools and also how to create a container cluster on an on-premises infrastructure.

## Project Description

In this project challenge, we created a local Swarm Cluster, using virtual machines, in addition to applying knowledge in Vagrant. We also learned a way to avoid manual deployments, improving developer performance.

## Step by step

:heavy_check_mark: `step by step 1:` Create a Vagrantfile with the definitions of 4 virtual machines. One machine with the name of master and the others with the names of node01, node02 and node03.

:heavy_check_mark: `step by step 2:` Each virtual machine must have a fixed IP.

:heavy_check_mark: `step by step 3:` All VMs must have Docker pre-installed.

:heavy_check_mark: `step by step 4:` The machine named master must be the cluster manager node.

:heavy_check_mark: `step by step 5:` The other machines must be included in the Swarm cluster as Workers.
